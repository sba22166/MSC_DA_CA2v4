CA2 - Big Data &amp; Advanced Data Analysis


Repo for final CA od Semester 2
This CA requires us to show off what we have learned throughout this semester for both modeuls

Due Date 26th May 2023 11:55

Requirements:

	1 Year of tweets 

 	Utilisation of a distributed data processing environment (e.g., Hadoop Map-reduce or Spark), for some part of the analysis.

	Source dataset(s) can be stored into an appropriate SQL/ NoSQL database(s) prior to processing by MapReduce / Spark (HBase / HIVE / Spark SQL /Cassandra / MongoDB / etc.) The data can be populated into the NoSQL database using an appropriate tool (Hado Sop/ Spark etc.)

	Post Map-reduce processing dataset(s) can be stored into an appropriate NoSQL database(s) (Follow a similar choice as in the previous step)

	Store the data and then follow-up analysis on the output data. It can be extracted from the NoSQL database into another format, using an appropriate tool, if necessary (e.g. extract to CSV to import into R/ Python etc.).

	Devise and implement a test strategy in order to perform a comparative analysis of the capabilities of any two databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase and CouchDB) in terms of the performance. You should record a set of appropriate metrics and perform a quantitative analysis for comparison purposes between the two chosen database systems.

	Provide evidence and justification of your choice of sentiment extraction.

 	Explore time-series forecasting and evidence and justify your choices and final analysis including your forecasts at  1 week, 1 month and 3 months.

	Your dashboard must be dynamic and interactive. Include your design rationale.
